    III. USER CONTENT<br>
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this EULA, You are allowed to create and use “User Content” (as
    defined below) in a non-modified form (exactly as produced by the Application) subject to the License Limitations
    and Specific Rules for User Content defined herein.<br><br>

    Any modification of User Content created by the Application or incorporation of such User Content into other works
    requires explicit written approval from LINKING. You are expressly prohibited from sub-licensing, renting, leasing,
    transferring or otherwise distributing the Application or rights to use the Application. This EULA does not entitle
    You to receive, and does not obligate LINKING to provide, hard-copy documentation, support, telephone assistance, or
    enhancements or updates to the Application.<br><br>

    3.1 SUBMISSIONS OF USER CONTENT<br>
    The Application may allow You to create content such as videos, data, photographs, messages, graphics, text, and
    other information (“User Content”), and to share such User Content with LINKING or with other sites, including
    social networking sites, as You may designate. You are solely responsible for Your User Content that you upload,
    publish, display, link to or otherwise make available (hereinafter, “share”) on or through the Application, and You
    agree that LINKING is only acting as a passive conduit for Your online distribution and publication of Your User
    Content.<br><br>

    The Application may enable sharing of User Content in two ways: (i) one-to-one (e.g. through SMS, email, KakaoTalk,
    and Facebook message); and (ii) one-to-many (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Everyplay, email). Unless explicitly
    stated otherwise herein, no User Content is stored by LINKING and LINKING only acts as a passive conduit, offering
    You a platform to create User Content and (solely to help You and for the sake of improving user experience)
    referring You to a third-party service (e.g. email client, Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube application) where You can
    decide what User Content to share, how, when and with whom.<br><br>

    You understand that unless explicitly stated otherwise herein LINKING has no control over the access to Your User
    Content, the sharing of Your User Content, the privacy or confidentiality of Your User Content and that You,
    together with the third-party service providers (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter), are subject to the terms of
    service of said third-party service providers and have the sole control over such User Content.<br><br>

    You agree not to share User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional
    distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to You, to any other person, or to any
    animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit
    children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking them for personally identifiable details, or otherwise;
    (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that LINKING deems to
    be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal
    privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening,
    profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without
    limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii)
    contains any information or content that You do not have a right to make available under any law or under
    contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that You know is not correct
    and current.<br><br>

    If You believe that certain User Content shared through the Application, but stored on third-party services (e.g.
    Facebook, YouTube, etc.), is infringing Your rights, please contact the respective third-party service provider
    where such User Content is stored.<br><br>

    You agree that any User Content that You share does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind,
    including and without limitation any “Intellectual Property Rights” (as defined in Section 7 herein) or rights of
    publicity and privacy. To the extent that Your User Content contains music, You hereby represent that You are the
    owner of all the copyright rights, including and without limitation, the performance and the mechanical and sound
    recording rights, with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recording
    contained in such User Content and that You have the power to grant the license granted below.<br><br>

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, LINKING reserves the right in its sole discretion to review,
    monitor, prohibit, edit, delete or otherwise make unavailable any User Content at any time without notice for any
    reason or no reason at all. By entering into this EULA You hereby provide Your irrevocable consent to such
    monitoring and You acknowledge and agree that You have no expectation of privacy concerning the sharing of Your User
    Content. If LINKING at any time decides, in its sole discretion, to monitor User Content, LINKING does not assume
    any responsibility for User Content and/or has no obligation to remove or edit any inappropriate User
    Content.<br><br>

    CREATING AND SHARING OF USER CONTENT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION IS NOT ENABLED FOR USERS WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES
    AS UNDER THE AGE OF DIGITAL CONSENT. <br><br>

    3.2 LICENSE GRANT FOR THE USER CONTENT<br>
    By creating User Content through LINKING Applications, You expressly grant, and You represent and warrant that You
    have a right to grant to LINKING a royalty-free, sub-licensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable,
    non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, monetize, list information regarding, edit,
    translate, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of, and otherwise exploit, all
    such User Content, as well as Your name, user name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in Your User Content, in
    whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in
    connection with the Application and LINKING’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including and without
    limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Application (and any derivative works thereof) or any
    LINKING Application in any media formats and through any media collections and in connection with various
    advertisements, such as banner ads, mobile ads, and video ads. You also hereby grant each user of the Application a
    non-exclusive license to access Your User Content through the Application, and to use, reproduce, distribute,
    display, and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Application or the Internet and
    under this Agreement.<br><br>

    3.3 SPECIFIC RULES FOR USER CONTENT<br>
    By creating User Content through LINKING Applications you agree to these Specific Rules that outline Your use of any

    and/or content based on LINKING Intellectual Property Rights, even if such content would be free.<br>

    obtained express prior written approval from LINKING.<br>

    reason.<br><br>

    3.4 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR USER CONTENT<br>
    LINKING takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that You or any other user or third
    party creates with the Application or shares through the Application. You shall be solely responsible for Your own
    User Content and the consequences of sharing or publishing it. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of
    any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content that You send, upload, download, stream, post,
    transmit, display, share or otherwise make available or access through Your use of the Application is solely Your
    responsibility. In connection with Your User Content and in addition to any other representations and warranties
    contained in this EULA, You affirm, represent, and warrant the following:<br><br>

    1. You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content to use such
    person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Application and this EULA, and each such person has
    released You from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.<br><br>

    2. Your User Content and LINKING's use thereof as contemplated by this EULA and the Application will not infringe
    any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights, privacy rights, and
    rights of publicity.<br><br>

    3. LINKING may exercise the rights to Your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment
    of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or
    otherwise.<br><br>

    4. LINKING is not responsible for any public display or misuse of Your User Content. You understand and acknowledge
    that You may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, objectionable, or inappropriate for

    to access and use the Application. LINKING does not guarantee that the Application is available in all geographic
    locations. You acknowledge that when You use the Application, Your wireless carrier may charge You fees for data,
    messaging, and/or other wireless access. Check with Your carrier to see if there are any such fees that apply to
    You. You are solely responsible for any costs You incur to access the Application from Your mobile device and/or PC
    device. Your right to use the Application is also predicated on Your compliance with any applicable terms of
    agreements You have with third parties when using the Application.<br><br>

    V. IN-APP PURCHASES<br>
    Although some of our Applications are free to download, all of our Applications may offer in-app purchases,
    including subscriptions (“In-App Purchases”). Even though our free-to-download Applications offer In-App Purchases,
    You can play and access all levels of said Applications and all of the features necessary to progress within said
    Applications without making any In-App Purchases using real money.<br><br>

    In-App Purchases may be made only upon entering Your app store password and You are responsible for maintaining the
    security of such password. Your authentication and security maintaining are subject to the specific terms of the app
    store and the operating system (“OS”) of Your mobile device. You should be aware of the iOS’ 15-minute and Android’s
    30-minute window after downloading an Application, during which time In-App Purchases may be made without the
    insertion of an app store password. You should also take into account that OS 2.1 or older versions of Android
    mobile phones do not require the entering of an app store account password to carry out In-App Purchases.<br><br>

    By completing an In-App Purchase You obtain a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable
    license to use virtual currency, virtual items, and other virtual content (“Virtual Items”) within our Application.
    Virtual Items are not redeemable or subject to refund and cannot be traded outside of the Application for money or
    other items of value. LINKING may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items and the price for
    Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. LINKING shall have no liability to You or any third party in the
    event that LINKING exercises any such rights.<br><br>

    By signing up for a subscription, You agree that Your subscription will be automatically renewed and, unless You
    cancel Your subscription, You authorize us to charge Your account for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal
    and the price of subscription will be the same as Your initial subscription period and price, unless otherwise
    disclosed to You at the time of sale. You can manage Your subscriptions in Your app store account settings. You
    should be aware that deleting the Application from Your device does not always result in the cancellation of Your
    subscription. <br><br>

    In-App Purchases range from U.S. dollar 0.01 to U.S. dollar 99.99. All rates are in U.S. dollar currency and are
    subject to change and localization to the local currency, which shall be done by the app store from which You
    downloaded the App, meaning that the prices may vary plus/minus 15%. You should always check the prices in the
    Application to get the real values of the Virtual Items You want to buy in Your territory.<br><br>

    In-App Purchases are subject to the payment terms and conditions of the mobile platform (e.g. iOS Platform, Android
    Platform, Windows Platform, etc.) from which You make Your purchase. LINKING does not control or manage the payment
    process. Please review the relevant terms and conditions of the applicable platform provider before making any
    In-App Purchases.<br><br>

    ALL PURCHASES ARE FINAL. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LINKING IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND
    THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS/SUBSCRIPTIONS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS
